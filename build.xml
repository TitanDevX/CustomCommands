                Ant can include other plugin's classes however it cannot repackage them.

                By default we use the local Foundation library cached in your m2 folder used by Maven

                However, if you have Foundation downloaded from github.com/kangarko/foundation you can just
                use the second line instead to include its source code within this plugin directly,
                just make sure you have Foundation in the same workspace folder where you have this plugin.
